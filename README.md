# spring-6
## Introduction
Spring Framework 6 released on November 2022 is the major version change and carries many high-impacting features, changes and upgrades into the Spring development ecosystem. Similarly, Spring boot 3, based on Spring 6, also changes a lot of things we need to take care of during the application development in the future.

One of the most important features is the support for native compilation, a move towards making cloud-native applications more efficient. It is in response to newer frameworks such as Quarkus and Micronaut that produce native applications with low memory usage and fast start-up times. Though we can do native compilation today using ‘spring-native‘ module, with Spring boot 3 we can seamlessly integrate with a starter configuration and specific build commands.
